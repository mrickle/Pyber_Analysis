# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this analysis is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. PyBer operates in urban, suburba and rural types of cities. in previous analysis data of ride count, average fare per ride, and average number of drivers, all categorized by the city type was analyzed. Additionally, we compared each city's metrics and the average ride fare to the total number of rides per city. For this challenge, we created a summary data frame that organized total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver and the multiple line plot.
## Results
from teh graph below we can see that the larger the population of a city type, the more fares are generated. We can also see that in the colder months into spring the fares go up and then fluctuate in the warmer months, maybe an indication that less people use transportation and walk or bike on their own. I also think the city types very in fluctuation the more populous it becomes.

## Summary
Based on the results below I would possible charge a premium winter charge during the months people will be more likely to need transportation and offer some sort of promotion to increase the number of fares, such as buy 1 get 1 ride 20% off. This would cause people to choose a ride versus the alternative based on assumed value.
